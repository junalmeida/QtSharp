# Building QtSharp

## Overview

I've put some details here on how to build the QtSharp libraries.<br />
QtSharp offers the possibility of using Qt from within a .Net managed language for a cross platform GUI
(something other than GTK / WinForms)

So far most of the documentation here surrounds the use of QtSharp with Visual Studio 2013.<br />
For these examples I'm using Qt 5.4.1 / Mingw 32bit version of Qt for Windows with the default install options

## General Order of things

* Building QtSharp
* Running QtSharp.CLI (Generate Bindings Code)

Optionally:

* Running NUnit Tests
* Building CppSharp

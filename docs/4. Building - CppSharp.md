# Building CppSharp

## Overview

In order to use QtSharp, we need CppSharp and LLVM (which CppSharp depends on).<br />
Since this project is still under developement, it's usefull to know how to build CppSharp <br />
CppSharp is where most of the work is done for generating the bindings

For QTSharp, we can ether use the pre-built dll's generated within the repository within the References directory
or we can try to generate our own from a more recent version of CppSharp / LLVM

## Building under Windows / Visual Studio 2013 / 32bit

This documentation is based on the below link with perhaps a couple of additional notes

  * [CppSharp - Getting Started](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md)

A couple of notes:

* It's probably a good idea to make sure to build it within directories that don't have spaces in the path name (at least for a windows box anyway)
* The version I'm using here is built to .Net 4.0
* Check the patches subdirectory in CppSharp for patches to experiment with

### Installed Pre-requisite Software

As part of the build, I'm currently using the following versions of software, although the latest stable versions should be fine

* Git 1.9.5 - Windows
* cmake-3.2.1 - WIndows
* Python-3.4.3 - Windows

## Downloading / Prepping Sources

### Cloning CppSharp

First we need to clone CppSharp <br />
For this example I'm using version ae4fab7db53d55a37defdc61fad4abd486f52f1d
but the latest release is probably the best for experimenting <br />

To clone the repo at the command prompt:

    mkdir C:\GITHUB
    cd C:\GITHUB\
    git clone https://github.com/mono/CppSharp CppSharp
    cd C:\GITHUB\cppsharp
    git checkout master

If you already have done a clone before, to update run

    cd C:\GITHUB\cppsharp
    git pull
    git checkout master

To see which version your on

    git rev-parse HEAD

If you want a specific version

    git checkout ae4fab7db53d55a37defdc61fad4abd486f52f1d

Theres a few different forks available

* [CppSharp - Original Upstream Tree](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp)
* [CppSharp - GoldRanks fork](https://github.com/golddranks/CppSharp.git)
* [CppSharp - ddobrev's tree](https://github.com/ddobrev/CppSharp.git)

### Cloning LLVM

Next we need to clone the LLVM Sources <br />
For the recommended commit number to use with the latest version of CppSharp<br />
see [CppSharp - Getting Started](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md)

    cd C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\deps\
    git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git llvm
    cd C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\deps\llvm
    git checkout 0e8abfa6ed986c892ec723236e32e78fd9c47b88

### Cloning Clang

Next we need to clone Clang <br />
Again check the above link for the latest commit number to use with the latest CppSharp

    cd C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\deps\llvm\tools\
    git clone http://llvm.org/git/clang.git clang
    cd C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\deps\llvm\tools\clang
    git checkout 3457cd5516ac741fa106623d9578f5ac88593f4d

## Building LLVM

Next we're going to build LLVM which is a depend of CppSharp, Clang will be built as part of this process automatically <br />
To get things to match up we're going to use a 64 bit build <br />
Note that while QtSharp and QtSharp.CLI run as x64 by default, it is possible just to change the arch to x32 in the project settings <br />
Also the project / source for the wrapper for QT will actually be x32 by default

This next part is taken from the CppSharp readme <br />
we first need to run cmake on llvm to generate the project files <br />
Followed by msbuild to compile LLVM <br />
Make sure to run this within a **Visual Studio Command prompt** so that it can find the msbuild command <br />
This selects **RelWithDebInfo** as the build configuration <br />

For 64bit:

    cd C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\deps\llvm
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64" -DCLANG_BUILD_EXAMPLES=false -DCLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS=false -DCLANG_INCLUDE_TESTS=false -DCLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS=false -DCLANG_BUILD_EXAMPLES=false -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=false -DLLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS=false -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=false
    msbuild LLVM.sln /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo;Platform=x64 /m

For 32bit:

    cd C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\deps\llvm
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" -DCLANG_BUILD_EXAMPLES=false -DCLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS=false -DCLANG_INCLUDE_TESTS=false -DCLANG_INCLUDE_DOCS=false -DCLANG_BUILD_EXAMPLES=false -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=false -DLLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS=false -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=false
    msbuild LLVM.sln /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo;Platform=Win32 /m

## Building CppSharp

### Generating the Project Files

Next we need to build CppSharp <br />
First generate the Project / Solution files

    cd C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\build
    GenerateProjects.bat
    Choose option 2 / Visual Studio 2013

Next you may want to have a look at the Build/patches directory <br />
For any patches to explore

### Fixes to Project Files

In order to get CppSharp to build on my system I had to make a couple of tweaks <br />

* Open CppSharp.sln with Visual Studio 2013
* Ignore the warning about upgrading project files, click OK
* Select Release from the top menu of Visual Studio
* If building x64 make sure x64 is also selected to match llvm

The first change:

* Next this appears to be needed to find the lib files during the build
* Right click the **CppSharp.CppParser** (C++) Project
* Select Properties
* Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories
* Add the following directory

    C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\deps\llvm\RelWithDebInfo\lib

The second change:

* Right click the **CppSharp.Parser.CLI** (C++) Project
* Select Properties
* Under Configuration Properties -> General
* make sure the Platform Toolset is set to **Visual Studio 2013 - Windows XP (v120_xp)**

Finally to do the build:

* Right Click Build the Solution within Visual Studio
* Wait lots
* Some of the tests may fail to build, but as long as the main library's build this is what counts

### Building CppSharp - Command Line

I've just put this here for reference, to build CppSharp from the command line <br />
(from a visual studio command prompt)

For 64bit:

    msbuild vs2013\CppSharp.sln /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64

For 32bit:

    msbuild vs2013\CppSharp.sln /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x86

The .Net level should default to 4.0 <br />
Which is fine since it matches the .Net level of QtSharp <br />
If you decide to change it to 4.5 / 4.5.1 you'll also need to change it for the QtSharp projects as well


### Copying the Built files

The dll output build should now be within

    C:\GITHUB\CppSharp\build\vs2013\lib\Release_x64\

Or Release_x32 for 32bit <br />
The important files that we need are:

    CppSharp.AST.dll
    CppSharp.CppParser.dll
    CppSharp.dll
    CppSharp.Generator.dll
    CppSharp.Parser.CLI.dll
    CppSharp.Runtime.dll

Note that the **CppSharp.CppParser.dll** is a bit special in that it's a native C++ dll not a managed .Net dll so you won't be able to add a reference to it <br />
You ether need to add it into the project as a Link, or alter your system path to point to it <br />

The QtSharp project already has a link to it in the project file for copying across (although this isn't visible under references) <br />
Backup the files within the References directory within QtSharp, and then replace them with these built ones

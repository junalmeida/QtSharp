# NUnit Tests

## Overview

The tests use NUnit to run instead of the inbuilt Visual Studio test system (more cross platform) <br \>

## Windows System Paths

In order to run QtCore (or any other Qt module) from within the generated QtSharp wrappers <br \>
We need to make sure the Qt library Dll's are findable by windows on the default path

* Go to **Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings**
* Click on **Environment Variables** at the bottom
* Select New, and enter in a new variable
* Name: **QTPATH** Value: **C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\Tools\mingw491_32\bin;C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\5.4\mingw491_32\bin**

The paths may vary depending on your version of Qt and where it was installed <br \>

* Edit the Path variable and add **;%QTPATH%** to the end of it
* Restart Visual Studio before trying to run the tests

## Running NUnit Tests - Visual Studio


In order to run the tests within Visual Studio:

First make sure the NUnit Test Adapter is installed for Visual Studio under the Extensions

* Within Visual Studio 2013 Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Install NUnit Test Adapter

Next we need to Build QtSharp.Tests (don't try to run it as a project, just build)

* Right click the QtSharp.Tests project and select Build

Next make sure the test / platform setting is set to x32 to match the architecture setting of the QtSharp library

* Test Menu -> Test Settings -> Default Processor Architecture -> X86

Next Run the Tests

* Test Menu -> Windows -> Test Explorer
* wait a while for it to analyse the available tests
* Click Run All

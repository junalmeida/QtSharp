# QtSharp Building / Running

## Setting up the Sources

First we need to clone QtSharp to our local machine

    mkdir C:\GITHUB
    cd C:\GITHUB\
    git clone https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp.git QtSharp
    cd C:\GITHUB\QtSharp
    git checkout master

Next we need to tell NuGet to download any missing depends into a packages sub directory <br \>
To do this at the command line

    nuget.exe restore QtSharp.sln

The other alternative is just to

* Open the solution in Visual Studio
* Right click solution
* Select "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution"
* Select the "Restore" button at the top right

This should create a packages subdirectory and download any needed external libraries

## Building QtSharp / QtSharp.CLI

### Visual Studio 2013

To build the sources under Visual Studio 2013

  * Open up the QtSharp.sln File within Visual Studio
  * Right Click Build on the QtSharp / QtSharp.CLI / QtSharp.Tests Projects

### Windows Command Line

### Mono Command Line

## Running the Build

QtSharp.CLI is the app to run to generate the bindings

To run from the command line

    cd C:\GITHUB\QtSharp\QtSharp.CLI\bin\Debug
    QtSharp.CLI.exe C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\5.4\mingw491_32\bin\qmake.exe C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\Tools\mingw491_32\bin\mingw32-make.exe

Or you could just add the above cmd line options to QtSharp.CLI under Project Properties and run it from within Visual Studio

This will do the following

  * The file Wrappers\QtCore\QtCore.cs will be overwritten with a new generated copy
  * Using the project file within Wrappers\QtCore\ the dll's QtCoreSharp.dll, QtCore-inlines.dll will be generated

  * The above will be repeated for any additional Qt Modules included in the build process

The 2 files needed for QtCore will be

  * CppSharp.Runtime.dll
  * QtCoreSharp.dll

Note currently there may be some issues when running QtSharp.CLI for the QtGUI Module <br \>
I found that rebuilding CppSharp seemed to fix this problem
